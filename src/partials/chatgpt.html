      ChatGPT does not give effective results to everyone WHY? 🤔
    </h2>
    <p class="chatgpt_text">
      📉 Limited training data: ChatGPT's ability to generate text is heavily
      reliant on the quality and quantity of training data it receives.
    </p>
    <p class="chatgpt_text">
      🤷‍♂️ Ambiguity in language: Language is inherently ambiguous, and ChatGPT's
      interpretation of a prompt can be influenced by the ambiguity of language.
    </p>
    <p class="chatgpt_text">
      🧠 Lack of domain knowledge: ChatGPT has a vast knowledge base, but it may
      not always have specific domain knowledge that is relevant to a marketer's
      needs.
